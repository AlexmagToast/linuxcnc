# These are binaries that interact with hardware and so far LinuxCNC expects these to run as root.

# linuxcnc_module_helper is a setuid root wrapper for insmod, and
# rtapi_app is the main orchestrator that runs the realtime parts of uspace
# LinuxCNC. These both need to run as root, and for now it is very much preferred to
# keep them setuid root rather than try to teach our users to run sudo.
